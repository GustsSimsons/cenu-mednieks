# Project Guidelines

## Important Notes

- **Always merge from the `dev` branch before starting work on feature branches.** This ensures you have the latest updates and reduces the chance of conflicts.
  
- **Push all your changes to the `dev` branch** once you finish working on a feature. 

- **Do not push or merge to `main`, please!** ðŸ˜Š
